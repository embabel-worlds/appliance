# Embabel Worlds -- one-command install (Windows / PowerShell).

#
# The Windows counterpart to install.sh. Same shape, same three steps:
#
#   1. check Docker is installed and running
#   2. download this repo into $HOME\embabel\worlds
#   3. hand off to worlds.py / me.py, which owns the actual setup
#
# It installs nothing globally, needs no admin, and writes only inside that one
# directory plus a two-line shim in $env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\embabel\bin.
# To undo it: `docker compose down -v` in there, delete the directory, and
# remove the bin dir from PATH.
#
# Environment variables (identical semantics to install.sh):
#   EMBABEL_HOME     where to install         (default: $HOME\embabel\worlds)
#   EMBABEL_REF      branch or tag to fetch   (default: main)
#   EMBABEL_MODE     worlds | me              (default: worlds)
#   EMBABEL_REPO     org/repo of the source   (default: embabel-worlds/appliance)
#   EMBABEL_TOKEN    GitHub token, private forks only
#   EMBABEL_BIN_DIR  where to put the shim    (default: $env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\embabel\bin)
#
# ASCII-only on purpose. PS 5.1 reads .ps1 files as the system ANSI codepage
# unless the file carries a UTF-8 BOM; box-drawing chars and em-dashes then
# come back as Mojibake and the parser dies. Piping over the wire (irm | iex)
# would be safe -- the site serves this as text/plain; charset=utf-8 -- but
# the file also has to work when someone saves and runs it locally.

  Embabel needs Docker, and it is the only thing you have to install yourself.

  Embabel is not one program. It is a knowledge graph, a server, a console, a
  document converter, a metrics stack and a sandbox that runs code your agents
  write -- six or seven pieces that have to find each other, come up in the right
  order and agree on their versions. Docker is how they arrive together, already
  wired, in about a command.

  It is also what keeps your world YOURS. Every one of those pieces runs on this
  machine: your documents are converted here, turned into vectors here by a model
  that runs here, and stored in a graph here. Nothing is uploaded to us, and
  there is no account to make. The only traffic that leaves is your model
  provider's, when you ask a question and your own key pays for the answer.

  And it is what makes this reversible. There is no installer scattering files
  across your system, no Java, no Node, no database to configure and no service
  left running when you are done. `embabel down` stops it; `embabel uninstall`
  removes it. What is left behind is the directory you chose.

  Docker Model Runner looks disabled, and Embabel needs it to start.

  It runs the embedding model -- the one that turns your documents into vectors so
  your world can search and reason over them. That model runs HERE, on this
  machine, with no key and no account, which is why document search costs you
  nothing and why nothing you feed it has to leave your machine.

  Enable it in Docker Desktop (Settings -> AI), or run:

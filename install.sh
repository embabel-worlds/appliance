# This script is short and boring ON PURPOSE. You are being asked to pipe a
# remote script into a shell, which is a thing you should be suspicious of, so
# everything it does should fit on one screen and read plainly:
#
#   1. check Docker is installed and running
#   2. download this repo into ~/embabel/worlds
#   3. hand off to ./me.py, which owns the actual setup
#
# It installs nothing globally, needs no root, and writes only inside that one
# directory. To undo it: `docker compose down -v` in there, then delete it.
#
# Environment:
#   EMBABEL_HOME   where to install         (default: ~/embabel/worlds)
#   EMBABEL_REF    branch or tag to fetch   (default: main)
#   EMBABEL_MODE   worlds | me              (default: worlds)

# --- 1. Docker ------------------------------------------------------------
# The one prerequisite we cannot install for you, and the one worth failing
# early and clearly on: everything below is pointless without it.
#
# WITH THE REASON, NOT JUST THE VERDICT. "Docker is required" is true and
# useless: it reads as one more dependency somebody's tool wants, at the exact
# moment a stranger decides whether this product is worth the trouble. Docker is
# not incidental here — it is how the appliance stays local, arrives whole, and
# leaves cleanly — so the refusal says that, and the person choosing has what
# they need to choose.
#
# THE COPY IS DUPLICATED FROM copy/, like the banner above and for the same
# reason: this script runs BEFORE there is a checkout to read it from.
# copy/docker-required.txt is canonical, scripts/check-copy.py compares the two
# byte for byte, and prose edited in one place fails the build if it is not
# carried to the other.
docker_required() {
  printf '\n'
  # Indented HERE, not in the file: everything this installer prints sits two
  # spaces in, and copy/ holds words with no layout — the same division of
  # labour as wrap_copy() on the Python side. Blank lines are left blank rather
  # than becoming two spaces of trailing whitespace.
  cat <<'DOCKER_REQUIRED' | sed 's/^./  &/'
Embabel needs Docker, and it is the only thing you have to install yourself.

Embabel is not one program. It is a knowledge graph, a server, a console, a
document converter, a metrics stack and a sandbox that runs code your agents
write — six or seven pieces that have to find each other, come up in the right
order and agree on their versions. Docker is how they arrive together, already
wired, in about a command.

It is also what keeps your world YOURS. Every one of those pieces runs on this
machine: your documents are converted here, turned into vectors here by a model
that runs here, and stored in a graph here. Nothing is uploaded to us, and
there is no account to make. The only traffic that leaves is your model
provider's, when you ask a question and your own key pays for the answer.

And it is what makes this reversible. There is no installer scattering files
across your system, no Java, no Node, no database to configure and no service
left running when you are done. `embabel down` stops it; `embabel uninstall`
removes it. What is left behind is the directory you chose.

Install Docker Desktop, start it, and run this again:

    https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/

if ! command -v docker >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  docker_required
  # die() adds the one line this case needs on top of the explanation: what

fi
docker compose version >/dev/null 2>&1 || die "Docker Compose v2 is required — update Docker Desktop, or install the compose plugin."

# explanation above would be condescending here: this person already chose
# Docker. One line, one action.
docker info >/dev/null 2>&1 || die "Docker is installed but not running. Start Docker Desktop, then run this again."

# Embeddings run locally, so the appliance needs Model Runner. A warning, not a
# failure: setup says the same thing with more room, and being told to fix two
# things at once by a script that then exits is a bad first minute. Same
# duplication rule as above — copy/docker-model-runner.txt is canonical.

  printf '  %s!!%s\n' "$C_YELLOW" "$C_RESET"
  cat <<'DOCKER_MODEL_RUNNER' | sed 's/^./  &/'
Docker Model Runner looks disabled, and Embabel needs it to start.

It runs the embedding model — the one that turns your documents into vectors so
your world can search and reason over them. That model runs HERE, on this
machine, with no key and no account, which is why document search costs you
nothing and why nothing you feed it has to leave your machine.

Enable it in Docker Desktop (Settings → AI), or run:

    docker desktop enable model-runner

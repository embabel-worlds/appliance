// Backup and restore — everything the appliance knows, saved to the host's
// own disk and brought back from it.
//
// WHAT A BACKUP IS. The appliance keeps everything a user would cry about in
// two named volumes — embabel_assistant_data (worlds, documents, artifacts,
// credentials) and embabel_appliance_neo4j_data (the knowledge graph) — plus
// the host-side files that make the checkout THIS appliance: .env, secrets.env
// and the mounts override. A backup is a plain folder holding a cold tarball
// of each volume, those files, and a manifest saying what made it.
//
// THE WORK ITSELF IS NOT HERE. It is `embabel backup` / `embabel restore`,
// which is setup.py's back_up() and restore() — the stop, the cold copy
// through a helper container, the config set-aside, the restart. That is where
// the appliance's other lifecycle verbs live, and two implementations of "copy
// the volumes safely" is how they come to disagree about which files matter.
// This module is the menu's end of that call: locate the checkout, run the
// verb with --json, hand back what it said.
//
// inspect() stays local, and only looks like an exception. It reads a manifest
// off disk to name a date in the confirmation dialog — no docker, no volumes,
// nothing that could be got wrong twice — and it is synchronous, which is what
// lets the dialog be built without a round trip.

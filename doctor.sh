# `embabel doctor` is the better tool and this is not trying to replace it. But it
# needs the `embabel` command, which needs a checkout, which needs the install to have
# got that far — and the failures that hurt most are the ones where it did not. This
# script needs nothing but a shell and, ideally, docker. Where docker is missing it says
# so and stops, because everything below that point would be a guess.
#
# READ-ONLY, ALWAYS. It starts nothing, stops nothing, deletes nothing, and never prints
# a password, a key or a token. Log lines are filtered to errors and warnings, and the
# report says so, because a log can carry the contents of somebody's world.
#
# Written for somebody who does not want to become a Docker expert today. Every finding
# says what to do about it, and the end says where to send the output if none of it
# helped.

"""Container memory limits are sized from Docker's memory, and a hand-set value wins.

WHY THIS EXISTS. With no limits, every service sized itself against the whole Docker
VM, and an ingest that had the app, the graph and docling busy together ran the VM
out of memory; the kernel killed the app JVM with nothing in its log (#111). The limits
only help if they add up to what Docker has, stay inside each service's minimum and
maximum, and never overrule something the operator wrote in .env.

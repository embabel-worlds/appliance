#
# WHAT A BACKUP IS. Everything a person would grieve over lives in two named
# volumes — embabel_assistant_data (worlds, documents, artifacts, credentials)
# and embabel_appliance_neo4j_data (the knowledge graph) — plus the host-side
# files that make this checkout THIS appliance. A backup is a plain folder
# holding a cold tarball of each volume, those files, and a manifest saying
# what made it. A folder rather than one enveloping archive on purpose: the
# tarballs inside are already compressed, and re-archiving gigabytes buys a
# second wait and nothing else.
#
# COLD ON PURPOSE. Community Neo4j has no online backup. So whichever mode is
# running is stopped, the volumes are copied at rest, and the SAME mode is
# brought back up — a copy taken under a live graph is corrupt in exactly the
# cases that make somebody reach for a backup.
#
# The bytes never cross a bind mount: a helper container tars the volume to
# stdout and this process streams that to a file (and back, on restore). So
# Docker Desktop's file-sharing list never has an opinion about where backups
# may live, and a backup can be written to an external disk.
#
# THIS IS HOST WORK, not server work — a container cannot copy the volume it is
# running from. It lives here, beside the other lifecycle verbs, because the Me
# app's menu and `embabel backup` must not be two implementations that disagree.

# The keys as the compose files declare them; the REAL names carry the project
# prefix, which is pinned in docker-compose.yml precisely so they cannot move
# out from under an install.

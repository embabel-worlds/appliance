"""How much memory each container may use, decided from what Docker has.

WHY EVERY HEAVY SERVICE GETS A LIMIT. With no container limit, every process sizes
itself as if it had the whole VM: the app JVM's MaxRAMPercentage is a percentage of
ALL of Docker's memory, Neo4j sizes its page cache from the same total, and docling
takes whatever a large PDF asks for. When they peak together — an ingest has all
three busy — the VM runs out and the kernel kills the largest process, which is always
the app. That is issue #111: a 7.65GB Docker Desktop, a batch of documents, and the
console reporting a 502 while the app rebooted with no error in its log.

With a limit, each service is sized against its own share, and a spike stays inside
the service that caused it: docling dies on a huge PDF and restarts, and docker
records OOMKilled against the container that actually ran out.

HOW THE SHARES ARE DECIDED. A fixed reserve for the VM and everything uncapped (the
console, sandboxes), a fixed cap for monitoring when it is on, then every sized service gets its
minimum, the rest is split by weight, and a service stops at the maximum past which
more memory buys it nothing — its excess goes to the others. Past every maximum, the
remainder is left unallocated, which is the right answer on a large machine.

The numbers are estimates from one working appliance, not measurements at the
boundary, and are named so they can be moved as better evidence arrives.

ANYTHING SET IN .env OR THE ENVIRONMENT WINS. This only fills in what nobody chose.

# ── seeding the documentation ───────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# A NEW WORLD IS EMPTY, and the first question anybody has — "what is this, and
# what can I ask it?" — is one the product could not answer about itself. The
# config views answer the structural half (what realms, what views, which model
# runs which job). This answers the prose half: the appliance's own guides, in
# the graph, searchable, on the first run.
#
# It costs nothing to send anywhere. Embeddings are local and always have been,
# so this is ~135KB through a model already running on this machine — seconds,
# no tokens, no provider key. It is the one corpus every new user wants and the
# only one we can ship without asking a question first.
#
# THE CREDENTIAL IS THE MINTED BEARER TOKEN, not the password the user just
# typed. The MCP step mints one for precisely this kind of call and hands it
# over once; setup holding a password to make an HTTP request would be a design
# smell that outlives the reason for it.
#
# BEST EFFORT, ALWAYS. Setup has succeeded by the time this runs. A world with
# no documentation in it is a smaller problem than an installer that fails at
# the finish line, so every failure here is reported and swallowed.

# The operator account, as it is created. Process memory only: never written,
# never logged, and used solely to authenticate the documentation upload below.

# A retrieval corpus has no way to discount a document; whatever matches wins. A
# proposal in a knowledge base is not incomplete information, it is confident
# misinformation, and it belongs nowhere near one.

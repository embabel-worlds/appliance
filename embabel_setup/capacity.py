"""What this machine can actually give the appliance, said before it costs anything.

WHAT DOCKER HAS, NOT WHAT THE MACHINE HAS. On macOS and Windows the appliance lives
inside Docker's own VM and can never see more than that VM was given — a 32GB laptop with
Docker set to 2GB runs out of memory, and a 8GB one with Docker set to 6GB is fine. Host
RAM answers the wrong question, and answering it would tell people to buy hardware when
the fix is a slider in Settings.

NUMBERS THAT WERE MEASURED, NOT SPECIFIED. Everything below came off a working appliance
rather than out of a requirements document, and the wording says so, because a limit
nobody has tested at the boundary is a guess with a decimal point. They are a warning and
never a refusal: an install that is merely tight should proceed and be told, and only the
person running it knows whether tight is acceptable today.

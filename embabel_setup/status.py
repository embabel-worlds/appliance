# ── the status line ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# First boot takes a minute or two, and for most of it the terminal said one
# sentence and then nothing. Silence during a long wait is indistinguishable
# from a hang, and the honest fix is not a spinner — it is telling the truth
# about what is happening, which the host can actually observe.
#
# WHAT IT SHOWS IS REAL, never a fake percentage. Three lamps, each read from
# docker or from the API on every tick:
#
#   graph    the neo4j container's own healthcheck
#   server   the mode container's healthcheck
#   API      whether the door answers HTTP yet
#
# A boot that stalls therefore shows WHICH of the three it stalled on, which is
# the difference between "it is slow" and a support conversation.
#
# ONE WRITER FOR THE BOTTOM LINE. The boot log prints from its own thread at the
# same time, and two writers sharing a line produce shredded output — so every
# log line goes through [log], which erases the status, prints, and redraws it.
# That coordination is the whole reason this is a class and not a print().
#
# It disables itself whenever colour does: piped output must stay clean, and a
# progress animation in a CI log is thousands of lines of carriage returns.

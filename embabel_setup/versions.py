# FOUR LAYERS DIFFER, and only one of them is the thing people say out loud.
# EMBABEL_VERSION defaults to `latest`, which is a name rather than an
# identity — two machines both "on latest" can be weeks apart. What
# pins an install is the image DIGEST, and what pins the code inside it is the
# commit the jar was built from.
#
# NOT AN HTTP CALL, deliberately. The server does answer this — /actuator/info
# carries the same build and git blocks — but it is authenticated, and more to
# the point the moment somebody needs the version is the moment the appliance
# will not boot, is wedged, or is halfway through an upgrade. An endpoint
# answers none of those. Everything below reads the image and the jar, and
# works with the container stopped.
#
# READING THE JAR CHEAPLY. The appliance jar is ~400MB and the container has no
# unzip, no python and a JRE with no `jar` tool. So: read the zip's central
# directory off the END of the file, find the one entry's offset, and `dd` out
# its couple of hundred bytes. Three small reads instead of copying 400MB to
# learn six lines.

# Where the git and build metadata live inside the Spring Boot jar. The Maven
# build bakes both in (git-commit-id-maven-plugin, spring-boot-maven-plugin).
